| Behavior our program should handle | Input description |  Output description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Ask to create a new account` | Username and password |  Success Message output
| `Choose to display credentials` | Type 'dc' when prompted |  Account credentials displayed
| `Choose to auto generate passwords` | Choose either 'y' or 'n' |  Password auto generated or user generates their own password
| `Delete a credentials account` | Choose 'del' | Account credentials are deleted
